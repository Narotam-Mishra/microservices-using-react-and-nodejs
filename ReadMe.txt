## Section 1 :- Fundamental Ideas around Microservices

# Lec 3 - What is a Microservice? (3:19)

# Monolithic Architecture - In monolithic server architecture, we have all of our code needed to implement our application inside of one single code base and we deploy that code base as one discrete unit. A monolith contains all the routing, all the middleware, all the business logic in all the database access code required to implement all features of our application.

# Microservice Architecture -  A single microservice contains all of the routing, all the middleware, all the business logic and database access required to implement one feature of our application.

# Monolithic vs Microservice :- A monolith has all the code needed to implement every feature of our application whereas a microservice has all the code needed to implement just one feature.

# Feature of microservice :- The best thing about this approach is that if for some reason, if every other feature or every other service inside of our application crashes or just mysteriously disappears, a portion of our app is still going to work just fine, as service, say is 100% standalone and doesn't necessarily require any other service to work correctly.

# A microservice contains all of the code required to make one feature work correctly.
